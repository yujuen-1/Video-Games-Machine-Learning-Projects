### The dataset named Video Game Sales with Ratings contains a collection of more than 16000 data which lists video games with sales above 100,000 copy.

* **Name** : Name of the game
* **Platform** : Console on which the game is running
* **Year_of_Release** : Year of the game released
* **Genre** : Game's category
* **Publisher** : Publisher
* **NA_Sales** : Game sales in North America (in millions of units)
* **EU_Sales** : Game sales in the European Union (in millions of units)
* **JP_Sales** : Game sales in Japan (in millions of units)
* **Other_Sales** : Game sales in the rest of the world
* **Global_Sales** : Total sales in the world (in millions of units)
* **Critic_Score** : Aggregate score compiled by Metacritic staff
* **Critic_Count** : The number of critics used in coming up with the Critic_score
* **User_Score** : Score by Metacritic's subscribers
* **User_Count** : Number of Metacritic's subscribers who gave the user_score
* **Developer** : Party responsible for creating the game
* **Rating** : The ESRB ratings

### Data Visualisation using Tableau
![tableau dashboard](https://github.com/yujuen-1/Video-Games-Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/assets/tableau%20dashboard%20view.JPG)

The graph above generated by Tableau shows that the data trends of video game sales are increasing from 1980, reaches it peak at 2008 and slowly decreasing over time for all markets until 2016. To understand the potentail factors that lead to the declining trend, additional reserch was conducted on top of the datasets.

According to the [video game statistics 2023 by WePC](https://www.wepc.com/news/video-game-statistics/), the data trend of the value of the video games industry is positive in the last decade, meaning the market is still growing. Moreover, the growth in gamers is a positive trend in the past decade, with 51% gamers from the Asia-Pacific area. However, while the number of gamers has increased significantly in the Asia-Pacific area, the North American region shows a slight decrease. 

Hence, some possible explanation for the declining trends observed comparing to secomdary research: 

* The markets in the dataset are not comprehensive. For instance, as the Asia-Pacific market has grown to take over almost 50% of the global value share of video game industry in 2016, but the dataset only includes Japan. Furthermore, China has grown to be the biggest game market in the world since 2016, exceeding the US gaming market and doubled the size of the Japanese market, which again explains the inaccuracy of the graph. 

*  Platforms included in the dataset are very limited. Mobile is missing but the mobile game market has been growing significantly over the past decade. According to [WePC](https://www.wepc.com/news/video-game-statistics/), the mobile game market took over 51% of global gaming revenue in 2020 while PC games and console games evenly splits the rest.

Fromm the current dataset, Nintendo was the top publishers. 

The dashboard also showed that most number of game released in year 1980 to 2016 are Sports genre, followed by Action genre and misc. This results coincide with the top 10 games global sales results, where "WiiSports" has the top global sales followed by "Grand Theft Auto V".   

### Proposed Machine Learning Projects

#### 1. Video Game Recommender System (Content-based Filtering)

The system take user's search history and will feedback information below: 
*     Top 5 Best Selling Games of All Time (of the particular genre)
*     Top 10 Games that user probably like

#### 2. Prediction of Sales (time series model)
